    "## What is Agent Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Framework is Microsoft's latest framework for building AI agents with these key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simpler API**: Clean, intuitive interfaces with minimal boilerplate\n",
    "- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with any chat provider (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, local models, etc.)\n",
    "- **Unified Threading**: Single `AgentThread` abstraction for conversations\n",
    "- **Built-in Tool Support**: Native support for extending agent capabilities\n",
    "- **Azure-optimized**: First-class Azure support while remaining provider-neutral\n",
    "- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade features and stability"
